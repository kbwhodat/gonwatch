# Gonwatch (Go and Watch)

A golang tui app that allows you to watch whatever.

### What can be watched?
- Movies
- TV Series
- Anime

For movies and tv series it comes with subtitles inlcuded. If there is none available, a call is made to [opensubtitles](https://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/subs). So, you might have to ensure the audio and captioning are in sync (rarely).


#### Issues
If you face any issues using this, let it be known so it can be fixed.
